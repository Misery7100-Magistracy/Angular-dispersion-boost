\section{Single cluster}

Within the Mie theory, it is well-known that we can significantly enhance the field amplitude near the target. To check this, $m$ values corresponding previously considered conditions $\lambda = \lambda_{10}$, $ka = 0.5,\:0.7$ was caltulated: $m_{0.5} = 1.635i$, $m_{0.7} = 1.851i$.

Total near- and far-field waa calculated in two cases: for $\lambda = \lambda_{L}$ and $\lambda = \lambda_{10}$ --- to compare their amplitudes and scattering profiles. We can see, that the scattering of the laser harmonic (first harmonic) is very close to Rayleigh scattering (\autoref{1h_ka0.5:image}b, \ref{1h_ka0.7:image}b) --- the incident plane wave profile almost does not change. Also scattering indicatrices in the plane of polarization correspond to the Rayleigh dependency~\cite{boren_huffman} (\autoref{ka0.5_far_field:image}, \ref{ka0.7_far_field:image} right).

A completely different situation in the case of $\lambda = \lambda_{10}$ --- the incident plane wave profile is distorted as a result of scattering and becomes like a diverging spherical wave (\autoref{10h_ka0.5:image}b, \ref{10h_ka0.7:image}b). The near-field amplitude is higher than for $\lambda = \lambda_{L}$ about 5 times for both radius cases (\autoref{10h_ka0.5:image}a, \ref{10h_ka0.7:image}a). Also scattering indicatrices in the plane of polarization have larger amplitudes, which suggests more efficient far-field scattering (\autoref{ka0.5_far_field:image}, \ref{ka0.7_far_field:image} left). We can see back-scattering enhancement on angles $\theta \approx 180^{\circ},\:120^{\circ},\:-240^{\circ}$ relative to the direction of the incident wave propagation.

The case $ka = 0.7$ compared with similar situation for scattering by a single nanocylinder~\cite{andreev_lecz} (\autoref{10h_ka0.7:image}c). We can see, that field distributions are similar include spherical outgoing far-field wave and localized near-field area in $0^{\circ}$ scattering direction relative to the direction of the incident wave propagation.
